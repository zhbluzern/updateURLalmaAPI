# updateURLalmaAPI


### Update bib records via Alma API

update several bib records through the alma api, replace the url in field 856$u and create field 024 with ark id.

The script reads the input file named 'SoSaGraphics_ARK_MMSIDs.json' (generated by other script) and loops through the list of ID-URL pairs. It downloads the bib record in marcxml, finds the 856 field, updates the url and creates an identifier field (024) and uploads the new bib record. This script assumes there is only one field 856 $$u.

To run this script, add the following:

Write your Alma API key in a file named config.py in the same folder as your script. The file should look like this:

(This file is under .gitignore, the API keys are not publicly shared)


api_key_nz = "NZ_API_KEY"

api_key_iz = "IZ_API_KEY"

This script assumes that field 856 contains the old links to the Sosa graphics (edoc.zhbluzern.ch) and can be overwritten (which is true for these ca. 2300 titles, but may have to be checked for another purpose).

## Remove a certain field

```python
    # Remove all 024 matching Subfield a with the given ARK
    
    '''
    marc_024 = marcxml.findall(".//datafield[@tag='506']")
    print(bib['ARK'])
    for field in marc_024:
        subfield_a = field.find(".//subfield[@code='a']")
        subfield_u = field.find(".//subfield[@code='u']")
        subfield_2 = field.find(".//subfield[@code='2']")
        print(subfield_a.text)
        print(subfield_2.text)
        #if subfield_a.text == bib["ARK"] and subfield_2.text == "ark":
        #    print("match ARK")
        field.remove(subfield_a)
        field.remove(subfield_u)
        field.remove(subfield_2)
    '''
```
